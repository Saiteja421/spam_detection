It is based on the idea of using Bayes' theorem, a rule in probability theory, to estimate the probability that an event will occur given the prior knowledge of certain conditions.\n","\n","> In the context of classification, Naive Bayes can be used to predict the class of a data point based on the values of a set of features that describe that data point. For example, in a spam filtering application, the features might include the presence of certain words in an email, and the class would be \"spam\" or \"not spam\". The Naive Bayes classifier would use the values of these features to estimate the probability that an email is spam, and make a prediction accordingly.\n","\n",">In this project we'll build a model that classifies messages as spam or non-spam."],"metadata":{"id":"UeMvRonj0vDs"},"id":"UeMvRonj0vDs"},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"a814eae4","metadata":{"id":"a814eae4"},"source":["\n","\n","\n","## Table of contents\n","\n","* **Importing Libraries**\n","* **Reading Data**\n","* **Creating Training and Testing Set**\n","* **Data Cleaning**\n","* **Calculating Probabilities**\n","* **Building the Classifier**\n","* **Testing**\n","* **Conclusions**\n","\n","## Importing Libraries "]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"metadata":{"id":"_NbFEuuDQ9F_","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1680452086320,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":5035,"user":{"displayName":"chikoti saiteja","userId":"18382143262797853140"}},"outputId":"365e69fb-6059-4709-bdf9-315150116cfc"},"id":"_NbFEuuDQ9F_","execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"/content/drive\", force_remount=True).\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":112,"id":"31c5e07c","metadata":{"id":"31c5e07c","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1680454209957,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":479,"user":{"displayName":"chikoti saiteja","userId":"18382143262797853140"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import re\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"1f808d61","metadata":{"id":"1f808d61"},"source":["## Reading Data\n","\n","This dataset is taken from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)\n","\n","Import the Google Drive module in Google Colab and mount it to download the dataset for training and testing the model.\n","\n","I have downloaded the dataset by providing the path to my Google Drive where I had already saved the dataset. \n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":114,"id":"6ec5d59d","metadata":{"id":"6ec5d59d","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1680454259116,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"chikoti saiteja","userId":"18382143262797853140"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["messages = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/DWDM Dataset/SMSSpamCollection', sep = \"\\t\", header = None)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":115,"id":"ed136d2c","metadata":{"id":"ed136d2c","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":423},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1680454261919,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"chikoti saiteja","userId":"18382143262797853140"}},"outputId":"6c477b17-42ac-4847-cb58-1ba748d1df7b"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["         0                                                  1\n","0      ham  Go until jurong point, crazy..
